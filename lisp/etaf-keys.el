;;; Commentary:

;; A Host declares `:keys', a list of (KEY COMMAND [LABEL]) entries, and the
;; key works while focus (or point) is inside that Host.  Each Runtime buffer
;; owns one emulation keymap holding every key any Host has declared; each
;; binding is a menu-item filter that resolves the key when it is pressed:
;;
;; 1. The scope starts at the focused Host, else the Host at point.  When a
;;    visible `:focus-scope modal' Host does not contain it, the scope starts
;;    at that modal Host instead.
;; 2. The registered Host and its ancestors are searched nearest first; the
;;    search stops after the first `:focus-scope modal' or `:key-scope local'
;;    Host.  A disabled Host contributes no keys but still bounds the search.
;; 3. The first entry matching the key wins.  Without one, the framework
;;    defaults apply: `M-g' opens region selection, Escape dispatches the
;;    nearest `:on-dismiss', `?' opens `etaf-help', Tab moves one tab stop,
;;    and an arrow key runs `etaf-direction' (the nearest `:on-direction'
;;    handler, a focused separator or slider step, then movement inside the
;;    surrounding region and its adjacent regions).  A local or modal scope
;;    ignores unbound printing keys so they never reach the application
;;    behind it.
;; 4. Otherwise the key falls through to the buffer's other keymaps.  Keys
;;    also fall through while a native input session edits the buffer.
