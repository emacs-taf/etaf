;;; etaf-app.el --- Application buffers over mounted Runtimes -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later

;;; Commentary:

;; An application is one named buffer showing one mounted View.  This module
;; owns what every such buffer otherwise repeats: the canvas display
;; settings, the default face that follows the application's theme, the
;; display, fitting application state to its window after each settled
;; change, and a single teardown however the buffer goes away.
;;
;; Window changes come from Ebox's viewport task, which already settles a
;; drag before it refits mounts; `etaf-app' fits in the same settle through
;; `ebox-display-window-change-functions', so an application needs no resize
;; hook, debounce timer or borrowed-line guard of its own.  Text scaling
;; refits through `ebox-display-change-functions'.

An open application of the same NAME closes first, running its ON-CLOSE.
The buffer gets canvas display settings, then shows through DISPLAY: t
selects it in the selected window, a function receives the buffer, and nil
leaves it undisplayed.  ON-FIT, a function of the display window, runs in
the buffer before VIEW mounts and again in one reactive batch after each
settled change of that window or of the text scale.  ON-CLOSE, a function
of no arguments, runs once in the buffer when the buffer is killed or
`etaf-app-close' closes it, while VIEW is still mounted.

BACKGROUND and FOREGROUND, each a colour string, ref, computed or
zero-argument function, remap the default face; a reactive source repaints
when it changes.  CURSOR, unless `inherit' (the default), sets
`cursor-type' before mounting.
MODE-LINE nil (the default) hides the mode line, t keeps it, and another
value becomes `mode-line-format'.  STATE is returned by `etaf-app-state'.
MOUNT-OPTIONS, a plist or a function of the display window (nil when
undisplayed) that returns one, are passed to `etaf-mount'; a function runs
in the buffer after ON-FIT, so options such as a fixed viewport height can
come from the fitted state.  If mounting fails the application closes, the
buffer is killed and the error propagates."
