;;; etaf-viewport.el --- Nested viewport regions for ETAF -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later

;;; Commentary:

;; A viewport is the region a mounted subtree lays out into.  The mount itself
;; provides the Runtime's viewport (see `etaf-runtime-viewport').  A nested
;; `etaf-viewport-region' wraps its content in one Host whose committed size
;; becomes the viewport of every Component below it, so an application reads
;; one reactive value whether it fills a buffer, a window or a pane.

;; Regions publish after each Ebox flush, when committed geometry is readable.
;; The region Host carries no padding or border, so its border box is exactly
;; the space its descendants lay out into.

;; Resolution walks the Component segment ancestors of the reader rather than
;; the inherited Context: content passed through a slot is compiled at its
;; call site, so a Context value provided inside a wrapper would not reach it.
